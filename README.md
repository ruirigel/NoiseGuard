## NoiseGuard

This is an application called NoiseGuard, designed to monitor the environment and detect high noise levels. Ideal for those who need a quiet space or want to ensure safe ambient sound levels, the app uses the deviceâ€™s microphone to measure decibel levels in real-time.

How it works: The app constantly checks the sound levels in the environment. When it detects noise above a safe threshold (for example, 65 dB), it activates an audible and vibrating alarm to alert the user to excessive noise. This alarm remains active for a set period, making it ideal for signaling sudden increases in sound that may be harmful or unwanted.

Automatic volume adjustment: To make the alarm less intrusive at night, the app automatically adjusts the alarm volume based on the time of day. From 8 PM to 10 AM, the alarm volume is reduced to a lower level (50%), and from 10 AM to 8 PM, it returns to maximum (100%), ensuring that the alarm remains effective but less disruptive at night.

The app also features a simple interface that displays real-time noise levels, allowing the user to monitor ambient sound easily and intuitively.
